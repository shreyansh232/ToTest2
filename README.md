# TOVOIR: AR Navigation App for Visually Impaired

TOVOIR is an augmented reality (AR) navigation application designed to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings using advanced machine learning and voice command technologies.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv3 machine learning model for real-time object detection, identifying obstacles and landmarks in the user's environment.

- **Spatial Awareness**: Provides spatial awareness through AR overlays, guiding users with auditory and haptic feedback.

- **Voice Command Integration**: Enables users to interact with the app using voice commands for navigation and settings adjustments.

- **Integrated Map**: Includes a map feature for planning routes and exploring nearby points of interest.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift**: Primary programming language for iOS development.

- **UIKit**: Used for building the user interface components.

- **YOLOv3**: Deep learning model used for object detection in real-time.
